Generates network configurations for remoteTech in KSP

for windows just download the .exe in the release section, mac you can run the python file directly (must install the dependencies though, can use this in cmd terminal once inside correct directory "pip install -r requirements.txt")

toggle custom relay network if you aren't interested in finding the minimum number of relays needed and or if you have a specific orbital height in mind.

It will also generate an elliptical orbit to allow you to deliver your relays equally spaced out, just release one relay per orbit at either the apo or peri apsis and then circularise that relay.

Almost all results are shown in Mm, 1Mm = 1,000,000m (1 x 10^6) = 1000km
